# Pizza Sales Project

## Overview

The Pizza Sales Project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization initiative designed to explore and interpret sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. This project leverages SQL for data extraction and transformation, combined with Power BI for creating insightful visualizations. The primary objective is to generate actionable insights that will enable the restaurant chain to optimize its operations, boost sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Acquisition

The project begins with the collection of raw sales data, which may include details such as customer orders, product specifications, order dates, and transaction amounts. This data can be sourced from various systems, including databases, CSV files, or other data storage platforms.

### 2. Data Transformation with SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is employed to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into an analysis-ready format. This process may involve tasks such as joining tables,using window functions , common table expressions , aggregating data, addressing missing values, and creating calculated fields.

### 3. Data Analysis

Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This may include:

- Identifying top-selling pizza flavors.
- Analyzing sales trends over time.
- Evaluating customer demographics and preferences.
- Calculating average order values.
- Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations.

### 4. Power BI Visualization

Power BI is used to create interactive and informative visualizations that showcase the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations may include:

- Bar charts and pie charts displaying sales by product category.
- Time series charts illustrating sales trends.
- Geographic maps showing the distribution of restaurant locations.
- Dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Power BI Visualization





### 5. Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis and visualizations, actionable insights and recommendations are provided to the pizza restaurant chain. These insights can help in making informed decisions to improve sales, marketing strategies, and overall business performance.
